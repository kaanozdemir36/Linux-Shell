# Linux-Shell
LSH is a simple implementation of a shell in C. It demonstrates the basics of how a shell works. That is: read, parse, fork, exec etc. 

Commands must be on a single line.

Arguments must be separated by whitespace.

No quoting arguments or escaping whitespace.

No piping or redirection.

Only builtins are: cd, ls, ls -la, pwd, touch and exit.
